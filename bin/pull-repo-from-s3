# Pull the repository files from S3
#
# Usage: bin/pull-repo-from-s3
#
# This will pull the repository files from the S3 bucket. This is useful
# because we want to make delta builds.
#
# Environment:
#   (Optional) AWS_PROFILE => Set which AWS profile is going to be used to
#     perform the S3 operations. This is recommended over using the access keys
#     directly.
#   (Optional) AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID => If not using AWS profiles, this should
#     point to the key created by IAM.
#   (Optional) AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY => If not using AWS profiles, this should
#     be the access secret of your key.
#   (Required) AWS_S3_PACKAGES_BUCKET_NAME => The bucket name where the
#     packages are stored.
#   (Required) REPO_NAME => The name of the repository file that you want to
#     add your built packages to.
#
# Informational:
#   This script will look for a file named sign-key-for-$REPO_NAME.asc at the
#   top level of the S3 bucket. Ensure that this file is there.
